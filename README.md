# Project_Decoder_Ring_1

This Project is build to encode and decode messages using three common techniques.

This site is really built for fun and may be utilized for games or events requiring problem/puzzle solving.

I hope to add further functionality to the site to increase the puzzles and bring more utility to the process of encoding and decoding.
